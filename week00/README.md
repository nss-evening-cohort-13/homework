# HW Week 0 - Things to do before class!!!

In a few short days we'll start our journey together to learn the basics of modern front-end web development. In the interest of getting off to a running start, here are some things that you can do to help the instruction team:

## General Admin Things
1. Take this [Typing Test](https://www.typing.com/student/test/3) at least 3 times and average your typing wpm together.  Remember your average wpm for step 6 below
1. Take this [Personality Test](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test) and remember your personality type for step 3 below
1. Complete this form: [General Information](https://forms.gle/qjiWc8CKL2hmmukbA)
## Installs

1. Install Google Chrome if you haven't already
1. Visit [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) and sign up with the same email address you gave to NSS
1. Download the [Zoom Client For Meetings](https://zoom.us/download#client_4meeting) and login to your zoom account there as well

Typically we would do this on the second day of class. We'd break out to Windows/Mac groups and power through it. If you feel confident in your abilities to follow written instructions/use the terminal, please do so:
1. [Mac Installs](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/Night-Class-Resources/blob/master/book-1-foundations/chapters/setup.md#installs-for-mac---osx)
1. [Windows Installs](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/Night-Class-Resources/blob/master/book-1-foundations/chapters/setup.md#installs-for-windows)


If you have any questions, drop them in the evening-cohort-13 slack channel.

## Prework
1. [Prework](https://nashville-software-school.github.io/web-development-foundations/) - This should be your final push to get all the prework done. Ask questions in slack, answer questions in slack, and generally try to help each other out!

## First Day Stuff!!!
We'll share the zoom call information through slack. The call will be scheduled to start at 5:30 on April 6, 30 minutes before class time, which should give everybody enough time to make sure they are able to join. If you have any issues, make some noise! We can't help if we don't know.
