# HW Week 1 - DUE by Sunday July 12th at 10am but earlier is better
Start at the top of this list and work your way down.  Things are listed in priority order.  Finish #1 below before you go on to #2.

## Study Group Assignment:
1.  None - study groups will start next week

## Individual Assignment(s):
### Administrative Stuff
1. Create a [github account](https://github.com).  Future employers will see this and you don't want to change it (git history is important) so think carefully about what username you choose.  For almost all students I suggest just going with some version of your first and last name.
1. Add your photo to slack **and** github.  Of your face - NOT your cat, dog, dinosaur, or BFF.  Your real face...semi recently.
1. Complete this form about [Studygroup Preference](https://forms.gle/4bSob9L6E4uDpkT47)
1. Go to the [classTracker app](https://classtracker.drteresavasquez.com) and click the "Login" button. **_NOTE: You have to have a github account created already._** A popup will appear and either flash or ask you to login. Then, nothing will happen. We will connect you to the app and let you know when you are good to go. 
1. If you have not already, download the [Kahoot app](https://kahoot.com/home/mobile-app/) from the App Store on your iOS or Android Device.

### Code Stuff
1. [Prework](https://nashville-software-school.github.io/web-development-foundations/) - you should be done with this already but in case you aren't you need to be by Monday.
1. Get acclimated with how we will be handling helping students by reviewing this README: [HERE](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-13/student-help/blob/master/README.md).

Finish everything? Good work!  Take this opportunity to have a nice long nap and/or a slice of pie!
